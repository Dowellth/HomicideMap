The purpose of this map is to show the number of murders by firearms in each state. Using graduated circle symbology I wanted to show the number of deaths involving firearms each state has. This data is not "cooked" and so the data is not a rate of deaths but it is showing how many people were murdered with firearms in 2021. Since this is my first graduated circle web map I went for more simple stylization choices such as the base map and the circles being black but changing to blue when hovering over them.
